Who am I?

For a while, I've tried on a few different labels. 

It started with coder... coach... photographer... videographer... dancer... choreographer... creative coder... artist... media artist... multidisciplinary artist... creative technologist... creative engineer... creative coach...

These labels are meant to summarize the scope of who I am as a human and while that is encouraged, it feels minimizing to make myself so easily digestible for whoever comes across.

The reality is that none of us, as human, living beings, are so easily understandable and packageable like we like to make ourselves believe.

The beauty of code and design is that it is creative and infinite. My whole self does not fit on a resume and frankly, it doesn't fit on all of these webpages. But for those who truly want to get a sense, and perhaps free your own self from the constrains of labels, this is for you.

Thank you for indulging me in this technological journey. It's an honor to be able to share and be witnessed in this way.
